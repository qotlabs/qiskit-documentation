# Documentation

Welcome to the community-hosted documentation mirror for Qiskit â€“ a popular open-source SDK for quantum computing. You can find recent Qiskit documentation similar to the [original IBM site](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/) but without geo-blocking restrictions.

Site content is based on the official GitHub repository [Qiskit/documentation](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation). Backend source code is largely based on the documentation-preview [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/qiskit/documentation) by IBM, with custom modifications. You can find the whole project in the GitHub repository [qotlabs/qiskit-documentation](https://github.com/qotlabs/qiskit-documentation).
