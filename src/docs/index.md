# Documentation

Welcome to the community-hosted documentation mirror for Qiskit – a popular open-source SDK for quantum computing. You can find recent Qiskit documentation similar to the [original IBM site](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) but without geo-blocking restrictions.

**Get started with [Hello World](/docs/tutorials/hello-world)**

## Development workflow
A framework for breaking down domain-specific problems and software capabilities in stages:

1. [Map the problem to quantum circuits and operators](/docs/guides/map-problem-to-circuits)
2. [Optimize for target hardware](/docs/guides/optimize-for-hardware)
3. [Execute on target hardware](/docs/guides/execute-on-hardware)
4. [Post-process results](/docs/guides/post-process-results)

## API reference
Guidance on how to use key APIs:
* [Qiskit SDK API](/docs/api/qiskit) – Open-source toolkit for useful quantum computing.
* [Qiskit Runtime](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime) – The platform to execute, manage, and optimize quantum computing programs in real time.
* [Qiskit Transpiler Service](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-transpiler) – Transpilation services in the cloud, including AI-enhanced transpiler passes.

## Tutorials
Explore utility-grade algorithms and applications with Qiskit Runtime:
* [Sample-based quantum diagonalization of a chemistry Hamiltonian](/docs/tutorials/sample-based-quantum-diagonalization)
* [Operator backpropagation (OBP) for estimation of expectation values](/docs/tutorials/operator-back-propagation)
* [Higher-order binary optimization with Q-CTRL's Optimization Solver](/docs/tutorials/solve-higher-order-binary-optimization-problems-with-q-ctrls-optimization-solver)

## Source
Site content is based on the official GitHub repository [Qiskit/documentation](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation). Backend source code is largely based on the documentation-preview Docker image by IBM, with custom modifications. You can find the whole project in the GitHub repository [qotlabs/qiskit-documentation](https://github.com/qotlabs/qiskit-documentation).
